[FUJIFULM X-T4](https://amzn.to/3QCmVPk) is my main camera for shooting videos for my YouTube channel. It supports recording in F-Log format, which allows you to do color grading beautifully.

It comes with IBIS but I guess it's basically for photo shooting. So, I'd use a gimbal when I film while walking outside.

Lenses I usually use are [XF16-55mmF2.8 R LM WR](https://amzn.to/3By677L) and [XF16mmF1.4 R WR](https://amzn.to/3xizKY9).
XF16-55mmF2.8 is an all-rounder lens. It is pretty useful when filming outside the home since you don't have to carry other lenses. XF16mmF1.4 gives you a pretty good bokeh. I love it.
