My old iPad stand holds my iPad at a fixed angle, which I didn’t like. So I needed a stand which is beautiful yet flexible. I found this one by [Yohann](https://www.yohann.com/product/ipad-stand/) — based in Switzerland. It took 2 months to be shipped to Japan because it was out of stock and I pre-ordered it. It’s made of a single chunk of wood that is carefully designed so that your iPad can be solidly balanced at one of three different angles, as you can see.

So, it works well both when you sit on a desk or when you stand in front of the desk. I love the design and versatility. It costs $149 and is not cheap but worth it in my opinion if you are searching for a beautiful and high-quality iPad stand.
