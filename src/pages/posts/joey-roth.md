These speakers are by [Joey Roth](https://joeyrothaudio.com/). I found them on Instagram in a post. I had to go ahead and research which ones they were exactly. One thing for sure though is that they look really nice and unique. The quality of the wood stand and the steel ceramic housing are very nice.

The sound quality is decent when it comes to highs and mids. But I found the bass to be lacking, so it is not suitable for listening to rock or dance music or things like that. It is not a big problem for me because I use other speakers in the other room when I enjoy music.
