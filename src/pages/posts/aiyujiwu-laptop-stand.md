This laptop stand is by an unknown brand called AIYUJIWU, presumably from China. It's small and foldable. I bought it at [AmazonJP](https://amzn.to/3xihmP7) and it's unfortunately not avialable in other countries. But you can find similar products by searching with keywords like "[laptop stand foldable kickstand foot](https://amzn.to/3xepShW)".

I really like its clean design, but one thing I don't like is that the feet don't have rubber, so they would be slippery on a desk. You should be careful not to make scratches on the desk.
I use it for my MacBook Pro at the moment.
