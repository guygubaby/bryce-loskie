MacBook Air is my sub-machine. As you may know, I'm running a small business called [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/). So, having a secondary computer is crucial in case the main machine breaks down. I must be available for providing user support and dealing with incidents.

I didn't feel like buying another beefy computer like M1 Max MBP. So, I decided to get the M2 MacBook Air.
It's less powerfull than Pro, but sufficient for looking into the servers, giving user support, web browsing, and doing some front-end coding.
It's hard to edit videos and build mobile apps on it.
But I love how lightweight it is. Great for hiking, travel, etc.
