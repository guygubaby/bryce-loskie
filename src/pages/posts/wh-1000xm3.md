I’ve been using these noise-canceling headphones by [Sony called WH-1000XM3](https://amzn.to/3rbn7cO), which is an old generation of their high-end wireless headphones. I can’t remember this terrible name but the quality is decent. The sound is great and the noise cancellation works pretty great. The latest model [WH-1000XM5](https://amzn.to/3xckUSV) looks absolutely cool though, I often carry it when I go to a cafe and am still happy with it.
