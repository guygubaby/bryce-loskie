To be honest, I don't really care about keyboards. So, I've been just using Apple Wireless Keyboard and was happy with it. But I wanted people to enjoy more the typing sounds, I started to search for good mechanical keyboards. Here, [Keychron Q1](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1) is one of my favorite keyboards at the moment.
Due to its weight, it stably holds on your desk.

The switches are [Gateron Zealios V2 67g](https://amzn.to/3RWbP8N). They feel clicky but sound not loud like brown switches. Love them.

The keycaps are [Double Shot PBT OSA Full Set Keycap Set](https://www.keychron.com/products/double-shot-pbt-osa-full-set-keycap-set).

Beautiful. Minimal. Good typing sounds.
