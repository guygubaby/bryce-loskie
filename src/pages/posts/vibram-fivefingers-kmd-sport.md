As standing on the stepper barefoot can be slippery and dangerous, I put on [five-finger shoes from Vibram](https://amzn.to/3an0qwh) — an Italian manufacturer of rubber outsoles for footwear. When you put on them, it feels like you are barefoot but feels stable as they hold your feet very well on the stepper. Walking pumps your blood and it improves your productivity. It’s just like taking a walk while thinking about things. It’s not quite as distractive for doing tasks like coding as you imagine. You will soon get used to it.
