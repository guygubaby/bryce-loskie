My monitor is [**Apple Pro Display XDR**](https://amzn.to/3QAeiVb). I was previously using iMac 2017 whose display has 5K resolution. I tried to find third-party 5K monitors but it turns out that there were very few options with the same resolution. So, I decided to go with Pro Display XDR which has 6K resolution. Thatâ€™s insane. The display size is big enough and it allows me to split a vim window into a lot of panes so that I can edit multiple files while referring to other files. I love this narrow bezel and minimal design.

Pro Display XDR has 3 additional USB-C ports behind it. I put a retractable usb cable so that I can quickly connect my phone or other devices with my mac.
