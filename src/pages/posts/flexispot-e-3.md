Standing desks have become popular these days because they are good for your health. A research says working while standing boosts greatly your NEAT - Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis, which means an energy consumption of your daily activity.

I bought a height-adjustable desk frame from Flexispot. It costs over 400 dollars but I think it's very powerful, so you don't need to worry about the weight of stuffs you put on top of the desk.
