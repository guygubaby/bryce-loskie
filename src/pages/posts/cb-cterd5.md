The biggest and hardest problem to attain a clean desk is cable management. Hiding the power bar and keeping all my cords neatly tied together in one place was a priority. To accomplish that, I bought this black mesh cable tray from [Sanwa Supply named CB-CTERD5 at AmazonJP](https://amzn.to/3AUu9Z6). It is long enough to hide the power bar and wires very well.

Since the tray can be easily opened like this, you can quickly access and manage them. And I screwed the power adapter to the back of the countertop. I have another cheap tray for storing cables that are not always necessary like an HDMI cable and USB-C cable for charging power.
