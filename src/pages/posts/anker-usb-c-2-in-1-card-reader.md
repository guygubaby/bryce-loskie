To import pictures and videos that I shot quickly, I was searching for a mini SD card reader that doesnâ€™t distract the setup. I found [this SD card reader from Anker](https://amzn.to/2Wuc2W7). Thanks to having two USB-C ports on the top of the Mac Pro, I can connect the SD card reader here.

*UPDATE(2022/09/09)*: I'm no longer using Mac Pro but it's still useful when using laptops without SD card slot like MacBook Air.
