I was using a cheap tripod until I started a YouTube channel and felt like I need a professional tripod. I found that my favorite YouTuber [Ryoya Takashima](https://www.youtube.com/c/RyoyaTakashima) uses [Gitzo GK1545T-82TQD](https://amzn.to/3eMfOGU), so I decided to go with it.
It's lightweight because designed for travel. It's also useful for filming at home because it doesn't take much space.
